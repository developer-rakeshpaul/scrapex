# scrapex v1.0.0-beta.3

Stability and test coverage release with safer result merging and improved LLM/embedding flow ordering.

## Highlights

- LLM enhancements now run before embeddings, so summaries/entities are available for embedding inputs.
- Safer merge behavior in extraction context prevents undefined values from overwriting prior results.
- Expanded end-to-end coverage with local HTTP mocks and real-world fixtures.

## Improvements

- LLM enhancement + extraction flow ordered ahead of embeddings for better downstream inputs.
- Merge logic filters undefined values to avoid accidental data loss.
- E2E tests now cover:
  - Scraping with redirects, robots.txt handling, and non-HTML responses
  - RSS/Atom parsing and discovery utilities
  - URL utilities (tracking removal, protocol-relative URLs)
  - Markdown parsing behavior
  - LLM HTTP provider and Ollama embeddings via local mocks (no external deps)
- Added realistic HTML/RSS fixtures to mirror production inputs.

## Documentation

- Updated embeddings, utilities, RSS parsing, and extractor docs for accuracy.

## Installation

```bash
npm install scrapex@beta
```

## Notes

- Requires **Node.js 20+**.
